# Tips
- use venv:
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - source [dir]/venv/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
- place classes in seperate files:
    - clean imports only off classes that you use
    - keeps venv clean
- add function input typing (makes debugging much easier)
- writing: classes are cased like SimManager, functions like sim_manager
- a lot of unused variables: total, total_distributed. Or use self.total so you can re-use, or use debugger to check code and remove unused variables
- add doc-strings everywhere. If you use a class in VS Code your written doc-string will appear and VS Code can help assist better
